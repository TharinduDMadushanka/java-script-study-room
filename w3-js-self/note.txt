~ JavaScript Output ~

- JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:
    - Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.use the document.getElementById(id) method.
    - Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
    - Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
    - Writing into the browser console, using console.log().
- Using document.write() after an HTML document is loaded, will delete all existing HTML:
- The document.write() method should only be used for testing.


~ JavaScript Print ~

    - JavaScript does not have any print object or print methods.
    - You cannot access output devices from JavaScript.
    - can call the window.print() method
